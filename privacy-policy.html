  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: August 1, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>ChatGPT Kit</strong> is a Chrome extension designed to help you organize your ChatGPT conversations. We
    take your privacy seriously. This policy outlines what data we collect (if any), how it's used, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>By default, ChatGPT Kit does <strong>not collect any personal data</strong>. All chat links, labels, and
    organization features are stored locally in your browser.</p>

  <p>However, if you choose to sign up for a premium account in the future, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email address (for account login)</li>
    <li>Saved chat data (e.g., hyperlinks, labels) stored in our database to sync across devices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>If you sign up, your email and chat data will be used solely to provide and improve the service, including syncing
    your data and managing your subscription.</p>
  <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.</strong></p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use secure methods to store and manage your data. All communication between your browser and our servers is
    encrypted using HTTPS.</p>

  <h2>4. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>If you're using the free version without signing in, your data is saved only on your local device and never leaves
    your browser.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party services such as Supabase and Stripe for authentication and billing. These services have
    their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to delete your data at any time. If you are a premium user, you can request full deletion of
    your account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@adam-solutions.io">info@adam-solutions.io</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, please reach out to us at <a
      href="mailto:info@adam-solutions.io">info@adam-solutions.io</a>.</p>

  <p>Thanks for trusting ChatGPT Kit! ðŸ’š</p>
